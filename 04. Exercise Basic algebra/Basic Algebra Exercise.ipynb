    "### Problem 1. Polynomial Interpolation\n",
    "We know that if we have a set of $n$ data points with coordinates $(x_1; y_1), (x_2; y_2), \\dots, (x_n; y_n)$, we can try to figure out what function may have generated these points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that **our assumptions about the data** will lead us to choosing one function over another. This means that our results are as good as our data and assumptions. Therefore, it's extremely important that we write down our assumptions (which sometimes can be difficult as we sometimes don't realize we're making them). It will be better for our readers if they know what those assumptions and models are.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we'll state two assumptions:\n",
    "1. The points in our dataset are generated by a polynomial function\n",
    "2. The points are very precise, there is absolutely no error in them. This means that the function should pass **through every point**\n",
    "\n",
    "This method is called *polynomial interpolation* (*\"polynomial\"* captures assumption 1 and *\"interpolation\"* captures assumption 2).\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be proved (look at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_interpolation) for example) that if we have $n$ data points, there is only one polynomial of degree $n-1$ which passes through them. In \"math speak\": \"the vector spaces of $n$ points and polynomials of degree $n-1$ are isomorphic (there exists a bijection mapping one to the other)\".\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a lot of ways to do interpolation. We can also write the function ourselves if we want but this requires quite a lot more knowledge than we already covered in this course. So we'll use a function which does this for us. `numpy.polyfit()` is one such function. It accepts three main parameters (there are others as well, but they are optional): a list of $x$ coordinates, a list of $y$ coordinates, and a polynomial degree.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we have these points:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "points = np.array([(0, 0), (1, 0.8), (2, 0.9), (3, 0.1), (4, -0.8), (5, -1.0)])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we need to \"extract\" the coordinates:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = points[:, 0]\n",
    "y = points[:, 1]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we need to calculate the interpolating polynomial. For the degree, we'll initially set $n-1$:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "poly  = np.polynomial.polynomial.Polynomial.fit(...)\n",
    "# TODO: Find a way to make the line shorter; call the correct arguments\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After that, we need to plot the function. To do this, we'll create a range of $x$ values and evaluate the polynomial at each value:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "plot_x = np.linspace(np.min(x), np.max(x), 1000) # If you want, pass the number of points as a parameter\n",
    "plot_y = poly(plot_x)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we need to plot the result. We'll plot both the fitting polynomial curve (using `plt.plot()`) and the points (using `plt.scatter`). It's also nice to have different colors to make the line stand out from the points.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "plt.plot(plot_x, plot_y, c = \"green\")\n",
    "plt.scatter(x, y)\n",
    "plt.xlabel(\"x\")\n",

So, complex numbers and 2D points are equivalent. What is more, we can draw a vector from the origin of the coordinate plane to our point. This is called a point's **radius-vector**.\n",
