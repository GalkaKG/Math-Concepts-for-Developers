    "### Problem 1. Markdown\n",
    "Jupyter Notebook is a very light, beautiful and convenient way to organize your research and display your results. Let's play with it for a while.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, you can double-click each cell and edit its content. If you want to run a cell (that is, execute the code inside it), use Cell > Run Cells in the top menu or press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, each cell has a type. There are two main types: Markdown (which is for any kind of free text, explanations, formulas, results... you get the idea), and code (which is, well... for code :D).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me give you a...\n",
    "#### Quick Introduction to Markdown\n",
    "##### Text and Paragraphs\n",
    "There are several things that you can do. As you already saw, you can write paragraph text just by typing it. In order to create a new paragraph, just leave a blank line. See how this works below:\n",
    "```\n",
    "This is some text.\n",
    "This text is on a new line, but it will continue the same paragraph (so you can make your paragraphs more easily readable by just continuing on a new line, or just go on and on like this one line is ever continuing).\n",
    "\n",
    "This text is displayed in a new paragraph.\n",
    "\n",
    "And this is yet another paragraph.\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Result:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is some text.\n",
    "This text is on a new line, but it will continue the same paragraph (so you can make your paragraphs more easily readable by just continuing on a new line, or just go on and on like this one line is ever continuing).\n",

    "And this is yet another paragraph.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Headings\n",
    "There are six levels of headings. Level one is the highest (largest and most important), and level 6 is the smallest. You can create headings of several types by prefixing the header line with one to six \"#\" symbols (this is called a pound sign if you are ancient, or a sharp sign if you're a musician... or a hashtag if you're too young :D). Have a look:\n",
    "```\n",
    "# Heading 1\n",
    "## Heading 2\n",

    "##### Heading 5\n",
    "###### Heading 6\n",
    "\n",
    "It is recommended that you have **only one** H1 heading - this should be the header of your notebook (or scientific paper). Below that, you can add your name or just jump to the explanations directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Emphasis\n",
    "You can create emphasized (stronger) text by using a **bold** or _italic_ font. You can do this in several ways (using asterisks (\\*) or underscores (\\_)). In order to \"escape\" a symbol, prefix it with a backslash (\\). You can also strike through your text in order to signify a correction.\n",
    "```\n",
    "**bold** __bold__\n",
    "*italic* _italic_\n",

    "\n",
    "I ~~didn't make~~ a mistake.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Lists\n",
    "You can add two types of lists: ordered and unordered. Lists can also be nested inside one another. To do this, press <kbd>Tab</kbd> once (it will be converted to 4 spaces).\n",
    "\n",
    "To create an ordered list, just type the numbers. Don't worry if your numbers are wrong - Jupyter Notebook will create them properly for you. Well, it's better to have them properly numbered anyway...\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. This is\n",
    "2. A list\n",
    "10. With many\n",
    "9. Items\n",
    "    1. Some of which\n",

    "    + Unordered\n",
    "        - list\n",
    "        \n",
    "##### Links\n",
    "There are many ways to create links but we mostly use one of them: we present links with some explanatory text. See how it works:\n",
    "```\n",
    "This is [a link](http://google.com) to Google.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Result:**\n",

    "This is [a link](http://google.com) to Google.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Images\n",
    "They are very similar to links. Just prefix the image with an exclamation mark. The alt(ernative) text will be displayed if the image is not available. Have a look (hover over the image to see the title text):\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "Did I mention these cells support HTML, CSS and JavaScript? Now I did.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Tables\n",
    "These are a pain because they need to be formatted (somewhat) properly. Here's a good [table generator](http://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables). Just select File > Paste table data... and provide a tab-separated list of values. It will generate a good-looking ASCII-art table for you.\n",

    "### Problem 2. Formulas and LaTeX\n",
    "Writing math formulas has always been hard. But scientists don't like difficulties and prefer standards. So, thanks to Donald Knuth (a very popular computer scientist, who also invented a lot of algorithms), we have a nice typesetting system, called LaTeX (pronounced _lah_-tek). We'll be using it mostly for math formulas, but it has a lot of other things to offer.\n",

One of them is to just write the expression for it, as we did above. Another way is to **plot** it.

    "### Problem 9. Trigonometric Functions\n",
    "We already saw the graph of the function $y = \\sin(x)$. But then again, how do we define the trigonometric functions? Let's quickly review that.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Right triangle](angle-in-right-triangle.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The two basic trigonometric functions are defined as the ratio of two sides:\n",
    "$$ \\sin(x) = \\frac{\\text{opposite}}{\\text{hypotenuse}} $$\n",
    "$$ \\cos(x) = \\frac{\\text{adjacent}}{\\text{hypotenuse}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "And also:\n",
    "$$ \\tan(x) = \\frac{\\text{opposite}}{\\text{adjacent}} = \\frac{\\sin(x)}{\\cos(x)} $$\n",
    "$$ \\cot(x) = \\frac{\\text{adjacent}}{\\text{opposite}} = \\frac{\\cos(x)}{\\sin(x)} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is fine, but using this, \"right-triangle\" definition, we're able to calculate the trigonometric functions of angles up to $90^\\circ$. But we can do better. Let's now imagine a circle centered at the origin of the coordinate system, with radius $r = 1$. This is called a \"unit circle\".\n",
    "\n",
    "![Trigonometric unit circle](triangle-unit-circle.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We can now see exactly the same picture. The $x$-coordinate of the point in the circle corresponds to $\\cos(\\alpha)$ and the $y$-coordinate - to $\\sin(\\alpha)$. What did we get? We're now able to define the trigonometric functions for all degrees up to $360^\\circ$. After that, the same values repeat: these functions are **periodic**: \n",
    "$$ \\sin(k.360^\\circ + \\alpha) = \\sin(\\alpha), k = 0, 1, 2, \\dots $$\n",
    "$$ \\cos(k.360^\\circ + \\alpha) = \\cos(\\alpha), k = 0, 1, 2, \\dots $$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can, of course, use this picture to derive other identities, such as:\n",
    "$$ \\sin(90^\\circ + \\alpha) = \\cos(\\alpha) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "A very important property of the sine and cosine is that they accept values in the range $(-\\infty; \\infty)$ and produce values in the range $[-1; 1]$. The two other functions take values in the range $(-\\infty; \\infty)$ **except when their denominators are zero** and produce values in the same range. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Radians\n",
    "A degree is a geometric object, $1/360$th of a full circle. This is quite inconvenient when we work with angles. There is another, natural and intrinsic measure of angles. It's called the **radian** and can be written as $\\text{rad}$ or without any designation, so $\\sin(2)$ means \"sine of two radians\".\n",
    "\n",
    "![Radian definition](radian.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "It's defined as *the central angle of an arc with length equal to the circle's radius* and $1\\text{rad} \\approx 57.296^\\circ$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We know that the circle circumference is $C = 2\\pi r$, therefore we can fit exactly $2\\pi$ arcs with length $r$ in $C$. The angle corresponding to this is $360^\\circ$ or $2\\pi\\ \\text{rad}$. Also, $\\pi \\text{rad} = 180^\\circ$.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Some people prefer using $\\tau = 2\\pi$ to avoid confusion with always multiplying by 2 or 0.5 but we'll use the standard notation here.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** All trigonometric functions in `math` and `numpy` accept radians as arguments. In order to convert between radians and degrees, you can use the relations $\\text{[deg]} = 180/\\pi.\\text{[rad]}, \\text{[rad]} =  \\pi/180.\\text{[deg]}$. This can be done using `np.deg2rad()` and `np.rad2deg()` respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Inverse trigonometric functions\n",
    "All trigonometric functions have their inverses. If you plug in, say $\\pi/4$ in the $\\sin(x)$ function, you get $\\sqrt{2}/2$. The inverse functions (also called, arc-functions) take arguments in the interval $[-1; 1]$ and return the angle that they correspond to. Take arcsine for example:\n",
    "$$ \\arcsin(y) = x: sin(x) = y $$\n",
    "$$ \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right) = \\frac{\\pi}{4} $$\n",

    "Please note that this is NOT entirely correct. From the relations we found:\n",
    "$$\\sin(x) = sin(2k\\pi + x), k = 0, 1, 2, \\dots $$\n",

    "it follows that $\\arcsin(x)$ has infinitely many values, separated by $2k\\pi$ radians each:\n",
    "$$ \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right) = \\frac{\\pi}{4} + 2k\\pi, k = 0, 1, 2, \\dots $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In most cases, however, we're interested in the first value (when $k = 0$). It's called the **principal value**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note 1: There are inverse functions for all four basic trigonometric functions: $\\arcsin$, $\\arccos$, $\\arctan$, $\\text{arccot}$. These are sometimes written as $\\sin^{-1}(x)$, $\\cos^{-1}(x)$, etc. These definitions are completely equivalent. \n",

In the most basic case, we can have \"uniform noise\" - that is, each point in our little noise space $[n_{min}, n_{max}]$ will have an equal chance (probability) of being selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Perlin noise\n",
    "There are many more distributions but right now we'll want to have a look at a particular one. **Perlin noise** is a kind of noise which looks smooth. It looks cool, especially if it's colored. The output may be tweaked to look like clouds, fire, etc. 3D Perlin noise is most widely used to generate random terrain.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Algorithm\n",
    "... Now you're on your own :). Research how the algorithm is implemented (note that this will require that you understand some other basic concepts like vectors and gradients).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Your task\n",
    "1. Research about the problem. See what articles, papers, Python notebooks, demos, etc. other people have created\n",
    "2. Create a new notebook and document your findings. Include any assumptions, models, formulas, etc. that you're using\n",
    "3. Implement the algorithm. Try not to copy others' work, rather try to do it on your own using the model you've created\n",
    "4. Test and improve the algorithm\n",
    "5. (Optional) Create a cool demo :), e.g. using Perlin noise to simulate clouds. You can even do an animation (hint: you'll need gradients not only in space but also in time)\n",
    "6. Communicate the results\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: [This](http://flafla2.github.io/2014/08/09/perlinnoise.html) is a very good resource. It can show you both how to organize your notebook (which is important) and how to implement the algorithm."
